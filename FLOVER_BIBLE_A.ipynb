My customers will say that is too much to pay, and I agree — but ifyou don’t pay, you don’t taste. Lately, I have been combining anchovies with nectarines, which I love.

The homemade mayonnaise I serve is made with eggs and just a little olive oil but mostly melted butter, which makes it richer and more flavorful — which is based on how it is made for the Chinese dish of shrimp and walnuts.

            "+ BACON Bacon can be salt, fat, and/or smoke, depending on the bacon you choose. You can also play with its texture, depending on whether you are using pork belly or crispy bacon. It is wonderful with vegetables. The fat is delicious, so ifyou are braising onions in bacon fat, reduce that down, and add a little onionjus and vinegar, you have a great sauce. Bacon just brings another layer offlavor to the vegetables. My dish ofBerkshire pork chop with scarlet turnips, roasted rhubarb, and smoked bacon with cherry-almond salsa seca represents the relationship between fat, salt, sugar, and acid; they are all there. The bacon brings complexity to the pork; the cherry brings acid balance; and the almond brings a different kind offat with crunch. The almonds in the dish are marcona, and every tenth one is extremely bitter, which adds another layer ofcomplexity. — TRACI DES JARDINS, JARDINIERE (SAN FRANCISCO)\n",
            "+ BANANAS I hate overripe bananas. We’ll actually freeze whole, unpeeled bananas, which will continue to ripen in the freezer and turn black. When we want bananas to use as a puree, we’ll pull them out and let them thaw before pureeing, and then add them to a cake or mousse. The flavor is much better this way. — DOMINIQUE DUBY, WILD SWEETS (VANCOUVER)\n",
            "+ BASIL (See also Basil, Thai, and Lemon Basil) I use basil a lot. I will add it at the very end ofcooking a dish, and it will totally change where the dish is going. Added at the last second, it gives a minty freshness that was not there before. Basil says “fresh” and “alive” to me. And although you can get it year-round, I associate it with summer. I think particularly offish and shellfish with basil. I cook a lobster with a sauce ofsweet Muscat or Sauternes, curry, and lime. This is a dish that has been played with. The shells have been chopped up, added to mirepoix, and turned into sauce. Then there’s wine. So when the basil hits, you have this whole new thing going on. It opens up the dish and makes it light. It goes against the \"worked-on” aspect ofthe dish. In Thai cooking, you will find coconut milk-based curry that will have whole leaves ofbasil in it. Basil becomes something of a vegetable served this way. — DAVID WALTUCK, CHANTERELLE (NEW YORK CITY)\n",

It has a hearty quality to it and I associate it with stocks and big flavors. I will use fresh or dried bay leaf. Fresh bay leaf has fresher flavor and is surprisingly more intense than dried bay leaf, but it’s still not as dramatic a difference as you can find with other herbs when it comes to fresh versus dried. — DAVID WALTUCK, CHANTERELLE (NEW YORK CITY)\n",
            "+ BEANS, FAVA (aka Broad Beans or Horse Beans) Fava beans have a great flavor. Cooks in the past would blanch them, and the flavor would be left in the water. Today, what I like to do with favas and other vegetables is to put them in a pan with a little water, olive oil, or butter, and to cover them while they cook. That way, all the flavor stays in the vegetables. IfI could cook for my customers the way I like to cook and eat at home, I would sweat some spring onions in a pan with butter or oil, covered, to keep in the flavor. Then I’d add the shucked fava beans and let them cook with a little water. At the last second, I’d toss in some chopped parsley or basil, and there’s your sauce. This would be great under some fish. Ifyou added some thyme and maybe a little lambjus, it would also work with lamb. — TRACI DES JARDINS, JARDINIERE (SAN FRANCISCO)\n",
            "+ BEEF — BRISKET You can braise brisket for hours, and it still tastes like brisket, making it ideal to prepare for large parties. Nothing is better than what the Texans do with brisket, and that is barbecue. I also noticed that Texans get the fattiest brisket I have ever seen, so the fat just melts away and the meat is self-basting. My favorite barbecued brisket is from Mueller’s outside ofAustin. He cooks it about twenty hours and then wraps it in brown butcher paper to let it rest — which I think is the key to his barbecue. — MICHAEL LOMONACO, PORTER HOUSE NEW YORK (NEW YORK CITY)\n",
            "+ BEEF — IN GENERAL I love blue cheese with beef. We make a dish with blue cheese sauce that has chicken stock, Dijon mustard, truffle juice, and fresh truffle. This is a sauce that has many layers offlavor. The mustard is barely there but adds much more flavor to the sauce than vinegar or lemon would. The sauce is served on a [beef] filet that has been poached in spiced red wine. The poaching liquid is made with Cabernet Sauvignon that has been reduced for 25 minutes to concentrate its flavor, juniper berries, pepper, star anise, fennel seeds, and cloves. The cooked tannin in the wine really brings up the meaty flavor ofthe beef. — GABRIEL KREUTHER, THE MODERN (NEW YORK CITY)\n",

            "+ BEEF — SHORT LOIN This is the T-bone steak. When it is cut double cut [that is, twice as thick], that is when it is a porterhouse. The story goes that it was first served in Lower Manhattan in 1815 at a porter house. The owner ran out ofhis usual cut ofmeat, and when a customer asked for something to go with his porter [beer], the owner cut him this huge piece of meat. It became known as a “porterhouse” steak. The porterhouse steak is part filet mignon and part strip steak. It is the perfect grilling steak. You get the tenderness ofthe filet, and the big beefy chewiness of the strip steak. — MICHAEL LOMONACO. PORTER HOUSE NEW YORK (NEW YORK CITY)\n",

A chuck also makes a good cut for stew because it has nice fat. When I was growing up, a “steak Episole” was chuck steak that had good fat, was seared well, and then cooked slowly with tomatoes, onions, and fresh oregano. You may not see chuck steak a lot on menus, but you see it a lot in burgers. In fact, this is my favorite meat for a burger.

            "+ BEEF — STEAK: HANGER Hanger steak is known as an onglet in French and is found on bistro menus. It is also a great value, which is why you see it on menus in smaller restaurants. A hanger steak is incredibly flavorful. There is only one per carcass, and it comes from the area close to the kidneys, so it has almost an offal flavor to the beef. It has become popular because it is different and not a typical-tasting steak. I like a hanger steak grilled and served rare to medium rare. Slicing is also important, because you have to cut it on the bias so that it is tender. I like a hanger steak served with a traditional sauce, such as a caramelized shallot and red wine sauce or a bourbon peppercorn sauce. It is important to caramelize the shallots so they get sweet and offset the gaminess ofthe steak. I use bourbon instead of cognac because it has more punch to it, and I’ll use four different peppercorns — white, black, pink, and green — with the last two modulating the flavor. Green peppercorns have the sharpness to cut through the richness. — MICHAEL LOMONACO, PORTER HOUSE NEW YORK (NEW YORK CITY)\n",
            "+ BEEF — STEAK: IN GENERAL I like to keep it simple and serve steak au poivre with a peppercorn crust and deglazed with bourbon or even good ole American rye, which has more flavor. I also like steak with a margarita sauce, which is a good, zingy sauce made with tequila, orange, and lemon zest, and finished with roasted chile peppers. — MICHAEL LOMONACO, PORTER HOUSE NEW YORK (NEW YORK CITY)\n",
            "+ BEEF — STEAK: SKIRT Skirt steak comes in a long strip and looks like a belt — it’s about two feet long and a couple ofinches wide. This is an incredibly flavorful cut and delicious. It is very reasonably priced as well. It is very popular in the Latin community, especially with Argentinians. You often see it flattened with a mallet to tenderize it [by breaking the meat fibers] and used in fajitas. This, along with the hanger steak, is the beefiest flavored cut ofbeef. We serve it in a chimichurri sauce, which is a classic Argentinian sauce made ofchopped garlic, onion, and parsley, plus white [we use champagne] vinegar, red pepper flakes, and a little olive oil. It grills really well. — MICHAEL LOMONACO, PORTER HOUSE NEW YORK (NEW YORK CITY)\n",

            "+ BUTTER, BROWN (aka Beurre Noisette) One ofmy favorite flavors in the world is brown butter. Afinancier cake made with brown butter is one ofthe best things ever. I have been making a brown butter vinaigrette for a jillion years! It is a super-easy pan sauce that 1 love as a warm sauce: I just brown my butter in a pan until it gets the noisette [brown] color, then add some balsamic vinegar. It doesn't even need to be expensive balsamic. You make an emulsification in the pan, and add a little salt and pepper and it’s done. The flavor ofbrown butter, salt, and acid is one ofmy favorites. It works well on different fish like scallops or halibut or soft-shell crabs. — TRACI DES JARDINS, JARDINIERE (SAN FRANCISCO)\n",
            "+ CABBAGE — IN GENERAL Cabbage often has the connotation ofbeing heavy, but in the fall, we’ll make a fine chiffonade of cabbage thats very light. I like to cut cabbage thin and roast it in a pan so that the edges just get brown because that tastes really good. We figured that out by mistake by putting cabbage into too hot a pan. After the chefraised his voice about how that is the wrong way to cook cabbage, we tasted it, and it was good! We now serve a green cabbage dish cooked this way with caraway seeds and walnuts, then deglazed with Calvados. We also add a little cider vinegar and olive oil to finish. It is a nice, easy marriage. It is not an unpredictable marriage; these things just all work together. We pair this with braised pork belly, but it would also work with a roasted breast ofsquab with its leg done in a confit. — MICHAEL ANTHONY, GRAMERCY TAVERN (NEW YORK CITY)\n",

Luckily, I recently found these short, fat carrots at the green market. We saute these carrots over an open fire so that they get a little smoky. When they are cooked, they become soft and creamy. Once cooked, we turn them into a puree with a shot ofcarrot juice at the last second. We pair this with farro that has been cooked like risotto, then add some pine nuts and more Thumbelina carrots that have been quartered. I don’t know what is more seductive: the smooth carrot farro with its light carrot flavor or the carrots themselves that are totally creamy.

I didn’t grow up liking cauliflower, but I do now when its well roasted or pureed. It has good water content, which makes for a very smooth puree, and it has a subtle yet distinct flavor.

            "+ CHEESE — IN GENERAL (See also specific cheeses) Since cheese is a near-perfect food, I sometimes look for the few nutrients missing in cheese that can be found in other foods. The two essential nutrients that cheese does not provide are vitamin C and fiber. This recommends fruits especially — and makes a great start to the day: cheese, some high-fiber vitamin C-rich fruit, some whole grain organic bread, and coffee. The breads 1 prefer with cheese are usually neutral flavored, though I fully appreciate the nutty or herbed or fruity breads as natural partners for cheeses. The main reason I prefer neutral flavors in my breads is because 1 don’t want to meddle with the flavors in the cheeses themselves. I’m kind of a purist on that! Usually, the softer the cheese, the harder the bread — to an extent. And high-pectin, high-fiber fruits [e.g., apples, pears, apricots, plums, nectarines, peaches, figs] make natural accompaniments for many, many cheeses. Which cheeses? My faves with my espresso to which I add a little unfiltered raw honey would be the pressed sheep milk cheeses: Ossau Iraty, Roncal, Zamorano, Berkswell, Spenwood, Trade Lake Cedar, Vermont Shepherd, manchego, or Pecorino Foglie Noce. But I’m happy with whatever is looking good, and preferably the harder aged cheeses: sheep, goat, or cow. — MAX McCALMAN, ARTISANAL CHEESE CENTER (NEW YORK CITY)\n",

For another dish, I was inspired by a diner down the street from us that had chicken and waffles on the menu, which is an old Southern dish. My take is to make a savory waffle and to add Boursin cheese with lots of herbs. Then I pair it with chicken thighs braised in a coq au vin blanc and serve it with spinach.

            "+ CHINESE CUISINE (See also Szechuan Cuisine) In Chinese cooking they have a technique called “red cooking” that is a dish braised or steamed with star anise, dark soy sauce, cinnamon, and rock sugar. I cook the oxtail for my timbale of oxtail and foie gras that way, and then clarify the broth and turn it into the aspic that holds the dish together. The foie gras is cooked separately and made into a terrine. The dish is then served with gingery pickled vegetables. It is not a Chinese dish in that it is not a dish that you would find in a Chinese restaurant, but it has Chinese influences. The idea of clarifying the broth is typically French. The use offoie gras is not very Chinese.

Corn dates back to the Aztecs, who also loved chocolate, so it’s funny when people ask, “Where’d you get the inspiration?” This starts with a layer of milk chocolate hazelnut praline paste, then the corn, and then crushed wafers that give it that Kit Kat candy bar texture; on top ofthat is some chocolate ganache, then a layer ofchocolate. To play off those flavors I serve some espelette [pepper] to give a little heat and some smoked salt from Wales. This dish is about the interplay ofthe chocolate and the corn.

So I had to figure out how to make a sauce out ofa dried piece ofsausage. We melted the chorizo in a pan for a long time, and ended up with a flavorful grease that was not that appealing. However, we emulsified it in an herb-infused clam broth, and it became velvety. It wasn’t greasy, and gave the sauce a little kick.

[Takashi Yagihashi was his chef at Detroit's Tribute restaurant.] Dessert has to make sense in the context ofthe rest ofthe meal. Being a pastry chefis exciting because you have a lot of autonomy, but you are still working within the chef’s framework. Takashi’s food was very Asian-influenced. This dish was meant to bring in Asian ingredients in a new way yet be something familiar. So we have rice pudding flavored with coconut, lemongrass, ginger, and vanilla, and diced apricot for texture. At the time I was introduced tofrie de brique, which is a Moroccan dough that is like a cross between phyllo and a wonton wrapper. I would wrap these ingredients in this dough and then saute them in clarified butter and slice them like a spring roll. Alongside I served green tea ice cream. This covered a lot ofbases for me: the warm and cold temperatures, the Asian influence, and doing something with boring old rice pudding. The coolest compliment I ever got was from Andrew Carmellini [chefofNew Yorks A Voce] who was sitting down with us and asked about my background.

The guests sit in the field among the com and tomatoes, and we cook a meal for them on a couple of grills. I made a com soup for this event. We removed the husks, then cut the kernels offtire cob. Then we used the husks, which produce a juice, to make a stock for the soup. Ifyou were to use cobs, you wouldn’t get the same flavor. It is important to keep the corn flavor pure. Most cooks would throw in a bunch ofvegetables in the stock, and what you’d get then is a vegetable stock with corn. I want to have a corny flavor in the end. We made a stock using the corn husks cooked with a little onion, water, and salt, and let it cook for about 45 minutes. What came out was the most amazing sweet broth. We added the corn, pureed it, and served it chilled. It was so sweet and full ofcorn flavor you would have sworn there were cream and sugar in it. We now make a corn husk broth to add to a corn, chanterelle, and Dungeness crab risotto with a touch of pesto. Basil pesto and corn really speaks to me. It is a wonderful combination. — VITALY PALEY, PALEY'S PLACE (PORTLAND, OREGON)\n",

We serve our version oftorrijas with poached apples and instead ofserving it with maple syrup, we serve it with Pedro Ximenez [a rich, sweet, Spanish sherry] syrup that has a raisin-like quality to it. The PX is just warmed and has a little glucose added to thicken it into a syrup.

The dish just hits the mark. I also serve a sweet date dish that I stole from Judy Rodgers of Zuni Cafe. My version is made with Medjool dates that have maple mascarpone smeared in, pistachios crumbled on top, and orange blossom water.

I begged Lee [Hefter, the chef] for his source! Surfand turfis not as much about having a piece ofmeat and fish on the plate as about the ideas they create for flavor combinations. The Kobe beeftriggered everything. I can’t serve steak at a fish restaurant, but the Kobe was so good I had to find a way to justify it on the menu. I came up with Kobe beef and escalar, with a brown butter that is classic with the fish. The final dish was inspired by having Korean barbecue at a friend’s house, which is when I realized how to bring it together. I wanted another element in the dish because the Kobe, escalar, and brown butter are all rich and all soft. The dish also has squash, Japanese pears, and napa cabbage marinated like Korean kimchee for just a moment.

When a dish has fennel pollen, even before the food hits your mouth you will notice a floral smell that gets you thinking ofsummer, lighter foods, and freshness. I use it with my sea trout dish, which is served with a simple salad ofgreen apple, fennel, jicama, pistachios, and dried gooseberries. The dish is topped with the pollen blended with some yogurt, lemon juice, and preserved lemon, which we drape over the fish.

Since we don’t have a wood-burning oven [in the middle of Manhattan], we have to tweak the recipe from the classic. We have to tweak the cream because ifwe don’t, it breaks and just becomes grease.

In the summertime, I like it with small potatoes and corn. I really like it with cilantro. For my dish Roasted Maine Lobster in “Folly of Herbs” with Baby Fennel and Salsify, I wanted to do something different with lobster besides a lobster sauce. I make a “tea” ofdried herbs: thyme, rosemary, fennel seeds, oregano, sage, mint, and tarragon. This is boiled and strained, then gets a dash ofRicard [also known as Pernod, an aniseflavored liquor]. The lobster gets finished with fresh parsley, mint, and fresh oregano. I chose these two vegetables because salsify is underused and underappreciated. I don’t blanch my salsify in water because when you do, the flavor stays in the water. I roast them and caramelize them a little bit, then deglaze with just a little water with a sprig ofthyme and a bay leaf. Baby fennel is good because it plays offthe Ricard and fennel. I quickly blanch the fennel and then caramelize it. — GABRIEL KREUTHER, THE MODERN (NEW YORK CITY)\n",

In terms ofvisual presentation, we are shifting into a new direction where the food looks like one thing, but is really something else. That adds an extra element of challenge for us. An example ofthis would be a [Mexican-inspired] nacho dish we just created. You get something that looks like chips, sour cream, salsa verde, and grated cheese. The cheese is actually grated from saffron ice cream that we have thrown into liquid nitrogen, that is put into a food processor grater. The salsa verde is made from kiwi, mint puree, and epozote to give it a little twist. The sour cream is a yuzu creme fraiche. The chips are made from pureed com tortilla chips that have been sweetened with powdered sugar, then pasted into triangles and deep fried.

You can take inspiration from all around the world and apply it to what you are cooking without making it “fusion.” In some cases, you can even take a classic and make it taste better. I worked with Floyd Cardoz [chef ofthe Indian restaurant Tabla in New York City] and learned a lot about Indian spicing and technique from him. One technique was turka, which is where you fry spices in oil or ghee [Indian clarified butter] until they pop. It really opens up the flavor ofthe spices. I use this cross-cultural technique when making a veal dish with a great mustard sauce, which is a classic French dish, and the result is not a fusion dish: Take black, yellow, and red mustard seeds and toast them in butter or olive oil until they pop; then add some shallots and vermouth and reduce it. Then, add veal stock with a splash ofcream and Dijon mustard.

I love pork belly — it is a poor man’s foie gras, the way it just melts in your mouth. I make the eggs in a double boiler that gives them a creamy texture, and finish them with fresh herbs. For the belly, we grill it and then braise it in citrus, champagne vinegar, and veal stock for six hours.

This has been on our menu for over a year but it took me a few tries to get right. I tried black olives, but they were too strong. I tried rosemary, but it was too earthy. I tried Brussels sprouts, but they were a little too bitter and didn’t complement the same way sweet fennel did. So though the combination didn’t work for the saddle, the black olives and rosemary led me to add some rabbit liver and stuffa whole boned rabbit. That dish did work.

I coat a standard tart shell with a layer ofliquid raspberry on top ofthat I place a rose parfait, which I pair with lemon and pistachio. To make the rose flavor not so overbearing, I use it in three different forms. I infuse rosebuds [used to make rosewater) in the milk for the parfait, and 1 also use rose syrup, which adds color and sweetness, and finally rosewater as well.

            "Salmon is a big part of cooking in the Northwest. We get ours anywhere from Oregon up to Alaska.\n",
            "The first cooking process that comes to mind in this part of the country is called cedar planking, which is a Native American technique. You see planking in all the best cooking catalogs, but the problem is that you cook the fish, throw it out, and keep the plank because the plank is inevitably more expensive than the fish! So here is one tip: Instead, do what we do and go to a lumber yard and pick up untreated cedar shingles. They come in a huge bundle for $16.\n",
            "To get the most out of plank cooking, the salmon needs to be brined or marinated. I have two favorite marinades — one that is wet, and one that is dry. The wet marinade is a 60/40 mixture of soy sauce and cream sherry, lots of sliced ginger, heads of garlic cut in half, and chopped scallions. The sherry adds just a touch of sweetness to the fish, which I like. Let the fish sit in that marinade for a couple of hours and then it is ready to take on the smoke.\n",
            "The dry marinade is a more traditional marinade of a 60/40 ratio of brown sugar and salt with orange zest [grated] on a microplane [fine grater], I mix this all together and lavishly rub it over a salmon with the skin on, which protects it from getting too salty or sweet. The sugar in this rub balances out the salt and adds another dimension to the fish with caramelization happening a lot quicker. The sweetness is almost hidden; it is that \"What’s-that-flavor?\" aspect to the fish. Marinate for a couple of hours, then wipe off the rub slightly, and it is ready to go. The 60/40 ratio of sugar to salt is good because it is pretty forgiving if you leave the fish in the marinade a half hour too long.\n",
            "I recommend brushing the plank lightly with some olive oil, throwing it on a hot grill, putting the fish on, and letting it catch on fire, because when the plank is on fire, that is the flavor you are looking for. When the burning plank gets close to the fish, cover the grill to smother the fire and let the smoke do the rest of the work\n",

I served this with a balsamic vinegar ice cream, and a basil-infused strawberry consomme. A note about the strawberries is that I cooked them on very low heat. It comes from the idea of gentleness, slowness, care, respect for the ingredients, and, in the end, a better-tasting fresh ingredient. 1 could have extracted more juice from the strawberries by bringing them up to a boil with a bunch ofsugar, but that results in cooked strawberries and not the fresh strawberry flavor you're after. — MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)\n",

Brining has been done forever with pork chops and chicken, and for the last five years you have heard about it with turkey. The success of brining is more about the salt and it getting in there and softening the protein strands. It is less about all the other flavoring agents.\n",
            "If you want to get started in your kitchen, start with a skin- and bone-on chicken breast. Grab some kosher salt, sugar, or honey as I do, some water, and brine the breast for 30 minutes.\n",
            "When you pull it out of the brine, rinse it. dry it, and let it sit in the refrigerator for a couple of hours so the moisture comes out. You will notice the difference in the texture. The marinated chicken — even if you overcook it — will not be dry. It is the best.\n",

A lot of times, this dish is just chicken scaloppine with peppers and tomatoes. Ours is a whole different dish: the chicken is on the bone, and brined first, which makes it nice and moist. With it, we serve a homemade peperonata with roasted peppers, onions, garlic, red pepper flakes, rosemary, fresh bay leaf, fresh thyme, and piment d'Espelette [a pepper from France with a smoky flavor]. Here is a place where technique plays a role in the flavor: When you roast peppers, the best way to get the skin off is to put them in a bowl covered with plastic wrap and let them steam. When they are done, you are left with the pepper liquid. What we do is cook with that liquid.\n",

The perfect vehicle for white truffles is hand-cut pasta that is egg rich. Eggs that taste like real eggs make a great pasta. Our pasta is egg rich and has 35 egg yolks to a kilo (2.2 pounds) of flour. You can get them in there, it is crazy! The pasta looks like a sunset. On the pasta, I would first put butter barely scented with sage, before shaving the truffles on top. Nebbiolo. Beef cheeks braised in Nebbiolo [wine]. To keep it simple, we serve roasted turnips and the reduced sauce with pomegranate seeds and that's it. We braise our cheeks for seven and a half hours. Most braised dishes go four hours, but not beef cheeks — anything less, and they are [still tough]. Anchovies. I love a really acidic anchovy vinaigrette for a bread salad. Anchovies with roasted garlic are like butter at this restaurant; they go in lots of dishes. We put them in lamb, we put them in between potatoes with chicken stock for a gratin. We love them. I like anchovies with sage on each side deep fried for an appetizer. We cook anchovies in olive oil with a little butter until they get toasty, throw in onions to caramelize, and serve this with fish. Hazelnuts. Chocolate and hazelnut is the perfect combination so we make gianduja and put it inside crepes and warm them and put chestnut honey on top. Most of the time hazelnuts end up in salad or ground for a final dusting for a pasta. Beet pasta that looks like candy wrappers is served on top of a warm plate that has just been smeared with Gorgonzola Piccante, then topped with ground hazelnuts just before it is served. Blue cheese and hazelnuts is it for me. Goat Meat. I just had spit-roasted goat at Da Cesare. If I knew I was going to die, I would get myself there [to the Piedmont region of Italy]. Roasted goat basted with garlic, olive oil, marjoram, mint, or rosemary is it.\n",

            "+ BRUNCH BRUNCH Customers are picky at brunch. They have all cooked what they think they like, they think they can do it slightly better than we can, and they want it twice as fast. So, we take the classics like pancakes or French toast, use them as building blocks, and push them a little further. We will offer seasonal pancakes. In the winter, we’ll make buckwheat pancakes with cinnamon and glazed oranges. Bridging spring into summer, we’ll offer corn and saffron pancakes with a spicy poached pear and fresh ricotta. Saffron and corn work really well together because ofthe floral nature ofthe saffron and sweetness ofthe corn. We will use poached pears on the pancakes until switching to blueberries for the summer, which give a real pop. The pears are poached in a red wine syrup with aleppo chile that is a sundried chile with a rich, round, sweet spice to it. The chile is not noticeable, but it acts like an acid by lightening, plus cutting the sugar and richness of, the pancake. When people eat pancakes, they naturally reach for butter. I don’t serve butter with my pancakes and instead serve fresh ricotta. We use ricotta from Anne Saxelby, who supplies us with a fresh, rich, velvety ricotta, and this gives a richness to the dish. — BRAD FARMERIE, PUBLIC (NEW YORK CITY)\n",
